            Christmas Tree:

            Every Christmas we  {{verb}}  to a   {{adjective}}   tree farm far away. This is not just any   {{adjective}}   tree farm. My dad and I    {{verb}}   onto the   {{noun}}   to    {{verb}}   for the perfect   {{noun}}  .  Some people like them   {{adjective}}  , but I prefer them   {{adjective}}  . After  searching for hours I usually   {{adverb}}   exclaim "Dad! The perfect tree is over   there!" Off we    {{verb}}   to get the tree. The problem is we always forget the  {{noun}}   and the  {{noun}}  . But at the end of the day we    {{adverb}}   get the tree and head home    {{adverb}}  . "I wish it was Christmas all year round"  I    {{adverb}}   think to myself.

                    Shopping:

                    Today I went shopping. When I arrived at the store I saw a   {{adjective}}     {{noun}}  , who upon noticing me    {{adverb}}   said "I need to   {{verb}}  ". "Well,   that was   {{adjective}}  " I thought to myself and walked in the store. The store had rearranged it\s inventory, so I felt    {{adverb}}   lost. I   walked up to store clerk and said    {{adverb}}   "I am looking for a   {{adjective}}     {{noun}}   that doesnâ€™t    {{verb}}   as often as the last one I had." The store clerk    looked at me with a   {{adjective}}   look in his eye and said, "What you are looking for can be found by the   {{noun}}  , if you see a   {{noun}}   that    {{adverb}}   can    {{verb}}  , then you've gone too far." As I tried to understand his directions, I thought to myself, "I should have just ordered it    on amazon.com, Their products seem to    {{verb}}   the perfect amount

                    Brainstorm:

                    Many say that brainstorming is   {{adjective}}   and does not   {{verb}}  . However, with the combination of the right computer and   {{noun}}   anyone  can lead a good    {{verb}}  . When you have    {{adverb}}   pulled together a   {{adjective}}      group of   {{noun}}   in a big room with lots of TVs then  magical things will happen. In the past we have    {{adverb}}   suggested  participants work together to find the most   {{adjective}}   solution. The   most difficult part is many   {{adjective}}     {{noun}}   like to   {{verb}} . This has proved to be    {{adverb}}   problematic.  But in the end the most important   {{noun}}   usually is brought to light.  Typically we try to encourage ideas to    {{verb}}  , and never shut ideas  down. This concludes our instructions. Thanks for    {{adverb}}   listening!
